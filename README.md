# Advanced Custom Fields Addons

* Version: **1.0**
* Requires: **Advance Custom Fields v. 3.3.9**

This plugin bolts on addon fields for Elliot Condon's [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com). It uses a defined libarary of tested and functional fields to activate on your site, future release will include ability to upload or create your own fields. 

This plugin does not store any of the addon code within the repo release. Rather this is just an installer that pulls from the supplied source by the **addon field author** (listed below). If the remote soure is moved or deleted then installing a field will fail in the interim until you update the plugin with the latest library of repo sources.

#### Currently the following fields are included in the library:

* Address by [Omicron7](https://github.com/GCX/acf-address-field)
* Advanced Number by [Fumito MIZUNO](https://github.com/ounziw/numfield-advanced-custom-fields)
* Categories by [Nontas Ravazoulas, Cubeweb](https://github.com/cubeweb/acf-addons)
* Date and Time Picker by [Per Søderlind](http://soderlind.no/archives/2012/03/09/time-picker-field-for-advanced-custom-fields/)

### Please note: This library references remote repos, if the source field files are removed or replaced this plugin must be updated with the new source repos. Upon updating you may need to update and refresh your active fields if a repo is failing to activate
